# User Story

AS A user
I WANT to organize my upcoming schedule and meals
SO THAT I can manage my time and life accordingly

# Elevator Pitch
Noted is an application which is designed to help us keep track of some of the many things we all worry about in our daily lives. From what to prepare for dinner, to what kind of weather to dress for, as well as trying to remember what time your upcoming appointment is scheduled for. With the app’s large catalog of recipes you will always have new ideas of meals at your disposal which you can find and save in the app for later. Not sure if you’re going to need to wear a jacket or just a T-shirt today? Just input your area code and find out the current weather conditions. Last but not least you can write and save notes with whatever message you’d like. We all lead busy lives with jam-packed schedules and the Noted app is the perfect tool to help organize your thoughts and ease your mind.

# Description
Noted is an application designed to help you keep track of your daily life. It comes equipped with two APIs which help it do so. These APIs are Open Weather for the current weather conditions in a specified area and Spoonacular which has a catalogue of recipes accessed through searching keywords. In addition you can write yourself reminders or notes to be referenced.

# Motivation for Development
Other than fulfilling the assignment requirements and displaying our coding capabilities the motivation to develop the Noted app is to create an application to help organize your daily life. Using the APIs abilities we can make activities that everyone does regularly easier.

# Technologies Used
Spoonacular food API:
An API with a catalog of recipes. Input a keyword and the titles of recipes as well as links to the website with the ingredients and cooking instructions will appear on the page.
Open Weather API:
An API which has weather information based on longitude and latitude. Input your area code and the screen will display the current temperature, min-max-temperature, humidity and wind speed in the designated area.

# Hopes for Future Development
* Finishing development on Calendar and Lists pages.
* Add more media query breaks to make mobile friendly.
